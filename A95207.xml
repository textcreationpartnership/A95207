            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>Conceiving you may have many falſe reports concerning our retrent, I thought fit to give you this true action following.</p>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>Pon the approach of the enemie with their whole body within two miles of <hi>Fenrith,</hi> on Friday night <hi>July</hi> 15. it was thought fit upon advice of a Counſell of War to draw off our forces from thence, and to retreat to <hi>Appleby,</hi> and further, if occaſion ſhould be: The reaſons moving, were, Firſt, The paucity of our forces, compared with the Enemies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned bodies. Secondly, We had ſome additionall forces coming up to us out of ſeverall Counties, as <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> County of <hi>Durham,</hi> and <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and it was not held wiſdom to hazard a fight with our ſmall number, conſidering the conſequences to theſe parts, and to the whole Kingdom, if it had not proved well; when we might eaſily retreat to ſuch advantages. Thirdly, We were tender in being too forward to engage, in regard we had not underſtood the pleaſure of Parl. upon the coming of the <hi>Scots</hi> Army into this Kingdom. Accordingly that evening we retreated from <hi>Penrith</hi> to <hi>Appleby;</hi> very ſafe, (the Enemy neverappearing in our Reer at all) where we lay from Saturday till Monday morning without diſturb, ance, (ſome illneſſe of weather,) though the enemy marched after-and pitched with their foot between the two Bridges, neer <hi>Broug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> Caſtle, ſeven miles from <hi>Appleby,</hi> and their horſe about them, but on Monday morning, they marched again with their whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy towards us, (it being a very dark rainy morning) were within a mile of our horſe guards, before they were diſcovered, all our horſe having been that night drawn together in expectation of their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, and continued together till the morning, and then not hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the enemies march, and through the great rain and cold, in which they had been all night, and not in quarters a fortnight
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:162020:3"/>
before, they were diſmiſt to ſome Towns near about <hi>Appleby</hi> for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment: Before they had well gotten to their quarters, came this Alarm, the enemy preſently appeared in three great bodies, upon three hils, very advantagious for them, within half a mile of <hi>Apple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,</hi> ſo that our horſe guards were forced to retreat towards the Town, and the enemy followed, our foot, were preſently in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and were drawn down, and placed at the ſeverall Paſſes, and Baracadoes to prevent the enemies horſe from careering in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Town, which they attempted to do, but were gallantly repul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and one of them taken priſoner, and wounded; hereupon moſt of our foot were drawn out of Town towards the Enemy, to line the hedges, and ſtop the Enemies approach, (till our horſe could be imbodied,) being placed neer the Enemies body, and much to their annoyance; the enemy drew out ſeverall parties both of horſe and foot; and attempted divers times to force our men from their Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and break into the Town upon us, before our horſe could come together, freſh parties relieving the other every quarter of an houre, but were repulſed, and forced to retreat as faſt as they came on, by our brave foot, ſeconded with ſome horſe, ſo that our men did get, and not loſe ground of them; nay, a ſmall party of our foot advanced up to one of the hils, where a great bodie of the enemies horſe were, <hi>viz.</hi> the Gallows hill, where the Gallows is, and gave them ſuch a charge, that they forced their body to retreat, and came off with Freedom, Safety, and Honour; during this time, our horſe were advancing up from their ſeverall quarters, the enemies bodies ſtanding as before, and not attempting any thing upon our particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar horſe quarters dividedly, and at laſt came all ſafe together, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing much by great ſhouting, &amp;c: to ſee their Enemy in the field, the foot continually crying out for a Field, a Field. This skirmiſh continued from 12 at noon, till 9 at night, that they could ſee no longer; and upon Conſultation at a Counſell of War what was fit to be done, it was reſolved, for the reaſons before mentioned, (though our men, both horſe and foot, would gladly have engaged in the field) to draw off, and go to <hi>Kirly Stephen,</hi> which was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued, and our foot drawn off accordingly from their hedges, guards, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> into the Town, and ſo we marched off.</p>
            <p>In this ſervice, <hi>viz.</hi> upon the firſt charge of our guard with the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies firſt party, Col. <hi>Harriſon,</hi> who ventured very far in his own perſon, and farther then his men would follow, (for he had hold of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:162020:3"/>
one of the Enemies Colours) received three wounds, <hi>viz.</hi> a cut on the wriſt, a prick in the back, and thigh, but we hope not mortall; Captain <hi>Cromwels</hi> Lieutenant, and one foot ſouldier of ours, were ſlain upon the place, and two or three of our men wounded, and Lieutenant <hi>Sh<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>rs</hi> taken priſoner, which is all the loſſe we know of; the enemy had many ſlain, many wounded, and ſome taken priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, particularly one of Duke <hi>Hamiltons</hi> Chirurgions, and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; the enemies foot, both <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Engliſh,</hi> were very unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to come upon ſervice, and would go on no farther then they had horſe on back to force them. The <hi>Scots;</hi> when any charge was given by our men, preſently threw down their Arms, Poles; and Meal-bags, and ran away, divers of their Armes were brought off by our men, and ſome left behinde. It muſt not be forgotten that the <hi>Lancaſhire</hi> foot did play their parts very well in this ſervice: our horſe were drawn off on the South ſide of the Town, and the Enemie and the Northſide, the River being between, which was ſo high with the rain, that neither party could ford over, and the bridge which we maintained againſt them ſo narrow, and barroca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doed, and the Enemies bodie ſo neer drawn up, that they could not well be drawm over to do ſervice. After we came to <hi>Kirly Stephen,</hi> it was not thought fit to ſtay there, conceiving the Enemy might interpoſt between the Paſſe and Yorkſhire, and ſo we came on to <hi>Bowes</hi> without any trouble of the Enemy, who never appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in our Reer, and came no further then <hi>Appleby</hi> after us, which if they had done, and ſought to have engaged us, we ſhould have adventured, and left the ſucceſſe to God; but this night at <hi>Bowes,</hi> we meet with Major <hi>Sanderſon;</hi> and Capt. <hi>Bradfords</hi> Troops, out of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> Colonel <hi>Wrens</hi> five Troops, and Captain <hi>Harleys,</hi> and Captain <hi>Perſons</hi> company, who are grown very thin by their lying at <hi>York.</hi>

               </gap>laimed for pay! (and indeed they are gallant men, if they were not too clamourous.) It was paſt nine next morning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we came thither, we poſſeſſed our ſelves of the Church, and Barſonage houſe, (a ſtones caſt from the hall) without oppoſition, ſent them the ſummons; to which we have theſe anſwers, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes here incloſed, we intended that day only to take a view, but it proved an ingagement. Very opportunely came to our aſſiſtance four Troops of horſe, and two of Dragoons ſent by Lieutenant Generall <hi>Gramwell,</hi> we fell on the work, entred the barns, ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and malt-houſe, within the fould, but without the Mote; it was a very ſharp diſpute betwixt one and ſix; we ſpent moſt of our ammunition, <hi>viz.</hi> four barrells of powder, ſent preſently to <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Leeds</hi> for more; we have about twelve men ſlaine, and thirty wounded, whereof a few of them mortally. On Munday we cut off their freſh waters, then ſet work men to draw out the Mote. And on Tueſday towards night compleated the work; Sir <hi>Henry Cholm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> then come to us, we ſent them that laſt ſummons, appointed Hoſtages, &amp; Treators, had a Rendition upon articles to this purpoſe, That they ſhould deliver to Sir <hi>Henry Cholmley,</hi> and me, the houſe and armes. Only the Governour and Maior <hi>Bonifant</hi> to have their horſes and ſwords, as likewiſe a horſe to one <hi>Iennings,</hi> a ſouth country man, who was one of their Treators.

And the common ſouldiers only to march away with his apparell, An houre before their march (which was ſeven at night) meerly by accident the fire from their own party took hold of their powder, blew up part of the houſe, ſlew 4 or five of theirs, but none of our men, and miſerably ſcorched about ſeaven or eight more, and the ſame flame hath conſumed all the buildings. I account it a mercy that it was done by themſelves, and cannot be objected againſt us, ſome few armes the ſouldiers reſcued, but got

little prize: The breach was on their part, in not rendring the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but chiefly, for that one of them took out a piſtoll, and many marched with their moneys, therefore it is confeſſed ſome loſt their cloathes, for which cauſe the Governour and <hi>Bonifaut</hi> refuſe to ſend the eleven Troopers, or render themſelves priſoners accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ingagement.

            <p>IF God ſhall give you ſo compaſſionate a heart to pity the lives of ſo many of your ſouldiers, with divers others that be now in your garriſon, we ſhall become humble ſuiters unto the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (whoſe former mercies ſome of you have liberally taſted) that you may have the latitude of favour, where of your ſeverall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions will admit you capable.

            <p>TO infer your concluſion, that the blood ſpilt ſhall be required at our hands, before you have proved that we ought not to defend <hi>our right and the Kings,</hi> with our blood, is very bad logick; your Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke not ſo pregnant, as may perſwade us to aſſent to ſo diſhonour able Conditions, upon ſo ſmall reaſon; but in order to the tenderneſſe we have of Chriſtian blood, if you pleaſe to appoint two of like Condition with ours, mentioned in my Letters to Sir <hi>Henry Cholmley,</hi> and ſend us Hoſtages, we ſhall embrace a Parley.
